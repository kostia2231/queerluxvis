                                means you have 14 days after receiving your item
                                to request a return without stating any reason.

                                To be eligible for a return, your item must be
                                in the same condition that you received it,
                                unworn or unused, with tags, and in its original
                                packaging. You will also need the receipt or

                                vangelis@lordvonpanen.com. If your return is
                                accepted, we’ll send you instructions on how and
                                where to send your package. Items sent back to
                                us without first requesting a return will not be
                                accepted. You will be in charge of the shipping
